R5(mike's awesome):
	- Added validMove/validMoveRelative method, which checks the new location is in bounds and not occupied.
	- Added occupied/occupiedRelative method, which checks the grid square is not occupied,
	- occupiedgrid stores booleans in a 1d array representing whether a grid square is occupied. Updated in playerMove()
		- Added occupiedArrayConvert method takes a (x,y) and returns the index of that element in the array
	- Added setOccupied and setUnOccupied (x,y)
	- Added functions gridX and gridY which get each units position on the grid, replaced a lot of "this.x/getPixel" shit.
	- Added functions gridXAdd gridYAdd which is gridX or gridY plus the parameter, in hindsight this didn't help much.
	- Added function drawOccupied() which will draw a red rectangle over any space that is occupied.
	- Added a check box, and code that links it to whether to execute function drawOccupied().
	- Currently an occupied space created at 1,1 to demonstrate.
