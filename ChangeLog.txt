R6(master, dave fork):
New Shit:
	- Split code up into multiple files
	- Added new array called "unitGrid," which holds units in their location on the grid
	- Added new attributes to Unit
		- gx - Grid X coord
		- gy - Grid Y coord
		- solid - true = unpassable, false = passable
	- Modified moveRelative() & moveAbsolute() to update the gx and gy positions
	- Modified playerMove() to move the unit around the board and in pixel space
	- Whether or not something is occupied is now checked based upon the solid attribute
	- Added a function addUnit(u)
	- Added a function moveUnit(u, prevgx, prevgy, gx, gy)
	- Added a function setGridSquare(u, gx, gy)

R5(mike's awesome):
	- Added validMove/validMoveRelative method, which checks the new location is in bounds and not occupied.
	- Added occupied/occupiedRelative method, which checks the grid square is not occupied,
	- occupiedgrid stores booleans in a 1d array representing whether a grid square is occupied. Updated in playerMove()
		- Added occupiedArrayConvert method takes a (x,y) and returns the index of that element in the array
	- Added setOccupied and setUnOccupied (x,y)
	- Added functions gridX and gridY which get each units position on the grid, replaced a lot of "this.x/getPixel" shit.
	- Added functions gridXAdd gridYAdd which is gridX or gridY plus the parameter, in hindsight this didn't help much.
	- Added function drawOccupied() which will draw a red rectangle over any space that is occupied.
	- Added a check box, and code that links it to whether to execute function drawOccupied().
	- Currently an occupied space created at 1,1 to demonstrate.
